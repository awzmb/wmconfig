:::::::::::::::::::About This Theme:::::::::::::::::::

Ambiance & Radiance Flat Colors Suite Is back for 2016 and GTK 3.18! Ubuntu 16.04 LTS! Mint!

With older builds avalible fot 15.10, 15.04, Debian 8, Linux Mint Debain Ed 2. 
Thanks to all the support from our users! Via feedback and thanks to any one who made contributions/donations (We got a few).

16.04 LTS Version! New for April 2016! Full support for LTS!

This version finally fixes Mate & Compiz Window Decoration issue! Ubuntu Mate users! we are sorry about this issue it has now been fixed. In our defense things got switched around on us durring a non LTS release.

Gnome Shell and newest GTK Users please note! We are working on a brand new theme called "Vivacious Colors" It was re-written from scratch to work better on all desktops! Its a brand new codebase please see our website!  It works on Unity too! so feel free to grab it! It is new and has a litte work needed but already looks and works alot nicer in alot of areas!! www.ravefinity.com!

Ambiance & Radiance Flat is a completely NEW, Modern , Beautiful and flat "reboot" of the Ambiance & Radiance GTK 2/3 Themes.
It features a modern and clean look in your choice of 13 vibrant colors. With fully integrated and tested support for many of the popular desktops Including: Unity,Cinnamon,MATE,XFCE,LXDE,OpenBox, Gnome Classic & Fallback. (RAVEfinity supports desktops many other themes barely even touch, We test and write support.) Gnome-Shell is NOT supported right now because... Well Umm lets not get into that. :)

Ambiance & Radiance Flat was Designed by the RAVEfinity Open Source Design Project, It has been in planning & development for over 5 Mouths. Completely redesigned top to bottom by RAVEfinity with main code based on Ambiance & Radiance Colors By RAVEfinity & Stock Ambiance. We keep some design elements of stock Ambiance but we have also redesigned lots of parts on our own. Alot of new design work has gone into this. But a huge thanks goes to Ambiance Authors for their great code, design and base.

This theme comes in 13 Vibrant colors: Blue, Spring Blue, Brown, Graphite, Green, Orange, Purple, Pink, Red, Teal, Yellow.
In Ambiance(Dark) , Radiance (Light) As well as Ambiance Fusion (Ambiance with a light toolbar for dark icon themes)

Each Color Comes in 2 Versions Original and Pro, 
There are Color buttons in Original and Mono/Colorless Buttons in Pro. We like Pro best ourselves but users have asked for color window buttons so we heed the call.

A&R Flat goes very well with Vibrancy Colors or Vibrantly Simple Icons By RAVEfinity as well. (They where designed together)

This theme has been designed to be compatible most gtk2/3 desktops out of the box and no longer requires a separate build for XFCE & LXDE, We have tested and made everything work in one build! 

Comes with optional special "Classic Borders" for Metacity & XFWM (Gnome 2 , MATE, XFCE) that have larger borders around windows for window managers without compiz making it easier to resize thwem. not many modern theme provide this. So we did.

Supports Ubuntu 16.04+ , Debian , LMDE 2 Arch, Suse, Fedora With GTK 3.14-3.16+ Only! 

Please Download and use our 14.04 version for "older" distros with GTK Versions 3.10- 3.12 This version is not backwards compatible!

- Please note how we will say "Ambiance & Radiance Flat", We are not the authors of plain Ambiance & Radiance as noted bellow. Nor are we endorsed or affiliated with them. See credits for full list of contributors and authors.

Ambiance & Radiance Flat aims to be a modern and unique theme bringing class and personality to your favorite desktop environment.
If you really enjoy it please be sure to find out ways you can contribute and ensure development can continue (There are alot of ways to help including just rating or doing a post about it). This work is done out of passion and care but it should be noted it takes alot of time. We wish this was not true we wish it was easy but it is not easy! It takes a lot of unpaid free time. So keep this mind when wondering when is that next build gonna come out. Because instead to writing one theme like most do, We have to maintain 40/colors variations on the same theme. This is done by hand! and tested extensively. Along with many other tweaks.

(!) We and others have tryed to write scripts to do the colors but it is not that simple. Lots of things have to re-named moved around and human intervention is needed in parts. Thus alot is done by hand. But do not let that fool you. Things are heavily tested by hand and by checksum shell scripts to make sure everything is "Perfect".

(i) That being said. We envision a program could be written with a GUI that goes replaces and changes parts of one core theme on the fly. But we do not have the know how to do this just yet. perhaps one day.

Story
The RAVEfinity project has wanted to do a flat theme for along time. we finally got the opportunity to do so. It's not about being like everyone else (OSX, Win, Android etc) Who have decided to go flat crazy lately. It's about creating something simple, clean and customizable. We don't get into design politics or trends per-say. But we feel a flat theme like this needed to be done to stay consistent and competitive with other platforms. You are freely welcome to choose "your side" or favorite. We also do a non flat version of this theme simply called "Ambiance & Radiacne Colors". However Not doing a flat theme in this day and age when all "competitor OSs" interfaces offer one sorta makes things feel dated we feel, If there is not at least an option available. There are many good flat GTK themes (Use whatever you like, but we have created what we envision) however this one was designed from the ground up to be use-able on a huge number of desktops and in amazing colors and with some Ambiance Theme design influences. Will we look back at this era or flatness in UIs? Who knows. But if we don't play in this field (With amazing alternatives still readily available) It's being close minded and kind of making yourself dated and uncompetitive. That being said we do non flat themes too so choose what you like best.
